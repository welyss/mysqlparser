	 * compatible with lock acquired by LOCK TABLES ... WRITE statement, i.e. SNRW (We can't get by by acquiring S lock at HANDLER ... OPEN time and upgrading it to
	 * SR lock for HANDLER ... READ as it doesn't solve problem with need to abort DML statements which wait on table level lock while having open HANDLER in the

	 * acquire any kind of table-level or row-level lock, as this can lead to a deadlock. Moreover, after acquiring SH lock, the connection should not wait for any
